		<p><strong>Curbside Thai</Strong> brings the rich flavor 
			of Thailand to North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, 
			with over 35 years of experience at the House of Asia, now 
			offers that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
			with our modern mobile food truck.</br>
		</br>
		</br>

		This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
			paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
			mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
			11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
			11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
			difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
			<em>Curbside Thai will deliver</em>.</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
		what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls <q>the finest Asian food 
		on or off the streets of Charlotte</q>.</p>
